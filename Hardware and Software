Description:------
Ultrasonic sensor Sensors measure distances by using ultrasonic waves. The sensor emits an ultrasonic wave and receives the reflected wave back from the target.
IR Sensor emits in order to sense some aspects of the surroundings.
Moisture Sensor measures the volumetric water content in the soil. ... Reflected microwave radiation is affected by the soil moisture and is used for remote sensing hydrology and agriculture.
DC motor which is connected to the digital pins of Arduino
We are using the serial monitor for the display
